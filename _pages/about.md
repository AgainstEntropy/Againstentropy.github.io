<!-- Hi, there! I'm 王奕豪 (Yihao Wang). I'm currently in [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a research assistant. 
At the same time, I'm enrolled in the Tandon Bridge Program of New York University.

I graduated from the department of Physics of Fudan University and obtained my B.S. degree in 2022.

My current research interest lies in the filed of artificial intelligence. And I am looking for graduate opportunities. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
